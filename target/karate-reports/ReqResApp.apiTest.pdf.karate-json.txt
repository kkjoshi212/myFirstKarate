It administers both economy-wide and\r\nindustry-specific legislation covering thousands of\r\nproviders of goods and services. The agency combines\r\nboth policy and regulation making functions with\r\nregulation implementation functions. CAV has been\r\ncommitted to achieving best practice in performing\r\nits regulatory roles.\r\nThere has been much discussion of the need to\r\nimprove the processes of making regulation in recent\r\nyears, but much less focus on improving the practices\r\nof regulators in implementing regulation. Experience\r\nsuggests to me that often the more significant gains\r\ncan be achieved by improving what regulators do\r\nrather than tinkering with what is on the statute\r\nbooks.\r\nThis view prompted CAV to initiate a Better Business\r\nRegulation project, the simple aim of which was to\r\nimprove CAV\u2019s regulatory practices. Subsequently, the\r\nVictorian Government established a Regulation\r\nBurden Reduction initiative, which further emphasised\r\nthe need to improve regulatory quality. CAV is a\r\nportfolio unit of the Department of Justice in Victoria\r\nand the Department embraced both the Better\r\nBusiness Regulation and Regulation Burden Reduction\r\ninitiatives as key priorities in 2006-2008.\r\nThis paper describes the Better Business Regulation\r\nframework developed by CAV and the Department of\r\nJustice. It is hoped that other regulators will be able to\r\nbenefit from the work we have done by applying the\r\nframework to their own circumstances and ultimately\r\neffecting improvements to their regulation.\r\nI would like to acknowledge the work done by Rod\r\nOverall (Overall Consulting) and the Allen Consulting\r\nGroup who have greatly assisted CAV in developing\r\nthe Better Business Regulation framework. The\r\ncombination of experience of the consultants and staff\r\ninvolved in the project has, I believe, produced a\r\npractical and innovative approach to assist in the\r\npromotion of regulatory reform.\r\nConsumer Affairs Victoria would welcome any\r\ncomments on the Better Business Regulation\r\nframework.

An extensive literature search\r\nrevealed that although there are widely accepted\r\nprinciples of \u2018good regulation\u2019, they concentrated\r\non the application of these principles in making\r\nregulation (primary and subordinate legislation).\r\nThere was little information on what constituted\r\ngood regulatory practice.\r\nThe project was initiated by CAV in 2005 and\r\nextended across the whole of the Department of\r\nJustice (DoJ) to develop and test a conceptual\r\nframework to provide guidance on good practice for\r\nregulators. Underlying this was a premise that the\r\nactivities regulators undertake are essentially similar,\r\nregardless of the particular object of the regulation, so\r\nthat it should be possible to formulate standards\r\n(termed \u2018good practices\u2019) against which regulators\u2019 can\r\nassess current practices and identify opportunities for\r\nimprovement.\r\nA conceptual framework was developed from the\r\naccepted principles and the literature, particularly from\r\nUnited Kingdom governmental sources. On the basis\r\nof that framework, an Evaluation Guide was developed\r\nand piloted for its workability in two regulatory\r\nschemes operated by Consumer Affairs Victoria.\r\nModifications were made following a review of the\r\npilot\u2019s outcomes. From mid 2008 and over an\r\n18 month period, the framework will be rolled out\r\nacross all regulators within the Justice portfolio.\r\nThis paper explains the BBR Framework and the broad\r\nprocesses for its application. Readers interested in more\r\ndetail are referred to the departmental contact noted in\r\nthe Preface.\r\nIntroduction\r\nIntroduction > 01\r\nBetter business regulation > 03\r\nThis project is being undertaken in the context of the\r\nVictorian government\u2019s commitment to improving\r\nregulation.\r\nThe BBR project was initiated by Consumer Affairs\r\nVictoria as a way of improving the quality of its\r\nregulatory practice. It now also forms part of the\r\nDepartment of Justice\u2019s effort to delivering reductions\r\nin regulatory burden and improving the effectiveness\r\nof regulation. It has been a DoJ Strategic Priority for\r\nthe last three years.\r\nDoJ is focusing on regulatory improvement which\r\nincludes the Government\u2019s broader commitment to\r\nReducing the Regulatory Burden, a\r\nwhole\u2013of\u2013government approach to reducing the\r\nadministrative burdens of regulation.\r\nThe BBR project will encourage better regulatory\r\npractice and ultimately lead to better regulatory\r\noutcomes. In this regard, the BBR project will support\r\nthe Reducing the Regulatory Burden initiative and\r\nimprove the way regulators operate by highlighting\r\nareas for regulatory improvement.\r\nBetter business\r\nregulation\r\nContext\r\nThe Victorian Government announced the Reducing\r\nthe Regulatory Burden initiative in 2006, designed to\r\nreduce the administrative burdens of State\r\nregulation. The Department of Treasury and Finance\r\n(DTF) has estimated that the administrative burden\r\nimposed by State regulation is $1.03 billion per\r\nannum.\r\nThe Victorian Government\u2019s approach is centred\r\non three elements:\r\n1. reducing the existing administrative burden of\r\nregulation by 15 per cent ($154 million) by July\r\n2009 and 25 per cent ($256 million) by July\r\n2011\r\n2. offsetting the administrative burden of any new\r\nregulation by making simplifications in the\r\nsame or related area, and\r\n3. undertaking reviews to identify actions to\r\nreduce compliance burdens, supported by\r\nincentive payments.\r\nSource: The Victorian Government 2006, Reducing the\r\nRegulatory Burden \u2014 The Victorian Government\u2019s Plan to Reduce\r\nRed Tape, http:\/\/www.dtf.vic.gov.au, accessed 11 December\r\n2006.\r\nReducing the\r\nregulatory burden\r\n\u2022 Targets for\r\nachievement\r\n\u2022 Financial support\r\nfor projects\r\n\u2022 Measurement of\r\noutcomes\r\nBetter Business\r\nRegulation\r\nGood regulatory practice\r\n\u2022 What does good practice\r\nlook like?\r\nProcesses\r\n\u2022 How can it be improved?\r\nAction Plans\r\n\u2022 Implementing improvement\r\nopportunities.\r\nRegulatory outcomes\r\n\u2022 More effective\r\nregulation\r\n\u2022 More efficient\r\nregulation\r\nBBR and reducing the regulatory burden\r\nPrinciples of good regulation\r\nAny exercise in evaluating regulatory practice and\r\nprocesses requires consideration of the principles of\r\ngood regulation. These include:\r\n\u2022 accountability\r\n\u2022 transparency\r\n\u2022 effectiveness\r\n\u2022 efficiency\r\n\u2022 proportionality\r\n\u2022 flexibility, and\r\n\u2022 consistency1.\r\nFor Victorian regulators the Department of Treasury\r\nand Finance Victorian Guide to Regulation provides\r\na useful introduction to these principles. Many of the\r\nprinciples in the Victorian Guide to Regulation are\r\nalso relevant for the day\u2013to\u2013day business of regulators\r\nwhen operating regulation. However, developing\r\nspecific good practices, particularly those related to\r\noperating regulation are not explicitly stated and need\r\nto be derived or inferred from the relevant literature.\r\nThe interpretation of \u2018core\u2019 principles can then be used\r\nto test the appropriateness of the standards.\r\nThe BBR project has been undertaken in five stages\r\nwith Stage 1 designed to answer two key questions:\r\n1. is it possible to develop a common framework\r\nfor assessing regulatory performance across the\r\ndiverse business regulators in DoJ, and if so\r\n2. what would a set of workable indicators of good\r\npractice look like?\r\nStage 1 of the project focused on:\r\n\u2022 consideration of approaches to benchmarking\r\nregulatory functions in Australia and overseas\r\nwith a view to drawing upon existing\r\nperformance indicators and the experience of\r\nother regulators, and\r\n\u2022 developing a framework for benchmarking\r\nregulators and a recommended set of\r\nobservable\/measurable indicators of regulatory\r\nperformance that:\r\n\u2022 is readily applicable to all business\u2013related\r\nregulatory functions undertaken within DoJ\r\n\u2022 assists the subsequent task of identifying\r\nareas for improvement in DoJ regulators\r\n\u2022 provides guidance on the application of the\r\nframework and indicators, and\r\n\u2022 facilitates a pilot of the methodology in\r\ntwo regulatory schemes.\r\nStage 1, which was completed in early 2007, resulted\r\nin the development of a preliminary BBR framework.\r\nThe framework focused on the similar regulatory\r\nactivities performed by the diverse schemes within the\r\nJustice Portfolio rather than on the very different\r\nregulatory outcomes being pursued by the various\r\nregulators.\r\nThe framework established in Stage 1 was subsequently\r\ntrialled and modified during Stage 2, the purpose of\r\nwhich was to:\r\n\u2022 assess the BBR evaluation framework as a\r\ndiagnostic tool to assess regulatory performance\r\n\u2022 assess the associated approaches and processes\r\ninvolved in applying the BBR evaluation\r\nframework, and\r\n\u2022 identify areas that need to be taken into account\r\nfor wider application of the BBR evaluation\r\nframework across CAV and other DoJ regulators.\r\nStage 2 concluded that it was possible to apply a\r\ncommon framework for evaluation and assessment\r\nacross the diverse regulators in DoJ. Importantly, this\r\nconceptual framework was translated into a\r\ncomprehensive set of good practices allowing\r\nregulators to self-evaluate their regulatory processes.\r\nStage 3 utilised the findings of the Stage 2 pilots and\r\ntranslated these into strategic action plans articulating\r\nthe regulators response to the findings of the pilots.\r\nThese action plans clearly outlined specific\r\nimprovement opportunities, assigned responsibilities\r\nand specified timeframes for implementation. Finally,\r\na regular reporting mechanism was established to\r\nreview progress towards regulatory process\r\nimprovements.\r\n04 > Better business regulation\r\n1 This list includes those principles most applicable to all stages of the regulatory cycle. Efficiency has been included as it is\r\nimportant for the operate stage, perhaps less so for the make and review stages, even though it does not form part of the\r\nVictorian Guide to Regulation. Flexibility refers to a regulator being adaptive (eg enforcement strategies, promoting compliance,\r\nrisk assessments) to changing circumstances. Cooperation has not been included as this is an over-arching activity in the\r\nregulatory cycle and covered elsewhere.\r\nProject approach\r\nThe BBR framework > 05\r\nThe BBR framework\r\nThe following sections provide an overview of this\r\nframework starting with a discussion, at a conceptual\r\nlevel, of the regulatory cycle.\r\nThe framework maps generic regulatory activities\r\nacross the life cycle of a regulatory scheme. It is broken\r\ninto three stages\u2014make, operate and review\u2014and\r\nshows the activities that are required at each of these\r\nstages. Although not represented in the diagram, each\r\nof the 10 activities around the three stages is further\r\nbroken down into specific tasks with good practices\r\nthat should ideally be in place for each of the tasks.\r\nWith many activities in the cycle performed by\r\ndifferent branches or agencies, coordination of\r\nresponsibilities becomes a large component throughout\r\nthe regulatory cycle. Accordingly, it is represented in\r\nthe diagram as a continuum around the cycle.\r\nWhile in concept the regulatory cycle is not new, the\r\ngood practices developed for each of the activities\r\nwithin the regulatory cycle have not been brought\r\ntogether in this way in the extensive literature\r\nreviewed. By drawing on the Victorian Guide to\r\nRegulation, other principles of good regulation, and\r\nexperience from other jurisdictions, the BBR project\r\nderived or inferred the practices to which regulators\r\nshould adhere. In all, the BBR framework proposes\r\n74 good practices for the 10 regulatory activities\r\naround the make, operate and review stages and the\r\ncoordination responsiblities.\r\nTo assist with the identification of those \u2018similar\u2019\r\nregulatory activities, the concept of a regulatory cycle\r\nwas developed as set out below.\r\nThe regulatory cycle\r\nPRINCIPLES\r\nGOOD PRACTICE\r\nCOORDINATE RESPONSIBILITIES\r\nR\r\nEV\r\nIE\r\nW\r\nMAKE\r\nOPERATE\r\nReview\r\nobjectives\r\nof the\r\ngovernm\r\nent\r\nintervention\r\nAssess\r\nperformanceof the\r\ngovernment\r\nintervention\r\nId\r\nen\r\ntit\r\ny\r\npr\r\nob\r\nle\r\nm\r\ns\u2019\r\nto\r\nbe\r\nad\r\ndr\r\nes\r\nse\r\nd\r\nby\r\ngo\r\nve\r\nrn\r\nm\r\nen\r\nt\r\nin\r\nte\r\nrv\r\nen\r\ntio\r\nn\r\nDesi\r\ngn\r\ngo\r\nve\r\nrnm\r\nen\r\nt\r\nint\r\nerv\r\nen\r\ntio\r\nn\r\nPlan\r\nimplementation\r\nof government\r\nintervention\r\nMonitor and\r\nenforce\r\ncompliance of\r\nregulated\r\nentities\r\nM\r\nan\r\nag\r\ne\r\non\r\ngo\r\ning\r\nreg\r\nist\r\nrat\r\nion\r\n\/\r\nlic\r\nen\r\nsin\r\ng\r\npr\r\noc\r\nes\r\ns\r\nEducatestakeholders\r\naboutgovernment\r\ninterventionsReceive and\r\nrespond\r\nto\r\nenquiries and\r\ncom\r\nplaints\r\nRegisterand\r\nlicense\r\nentities\r\nLife cycle of a regulatory scheme\r\n06 > The BBR framework\r\n2 The discussion in this report is designed to be inclusive and therefore the term \u2018regulation\u2019 should be interpreted in its wider\r\nsense to include all government regulatory instruments including primary legislation and sub\u2013ordinate legislation (called\r\n\u2018Regulation\u2019) rather than sub\u2013ordinate legislation only.\r\n3 Regulation Task Force 2006, Rethinking Regulation: Report of the Task Force on Reducing Regulatory Burdens on Business, Report to\r\nthe Prime Minister and the Treasurer, Canberra, January, p. 145.\r\n4 Department of Treasury and Finance 2005, The Victorian Guide to Regulation,\r\nhttp:\/\/www.vcec.vic.gov.au\/CA256EAF001C7B21\/WebObj\/VictorianGuidetoRegulation\/$File\/Victorian%20Guide%20to%20Reg\r\nulation.pdf, accessed 6 December 2006, pp. 3\u20131.\r\n5 It should be noted that the above summary is by no means a substitute for the Victorian Guide to Regulation\u2014in fact, the\r\nGuide is the endorsed Government policy on developing regulation\u2014nor is the summary intended to provide greater emphasis\r\nrelative to those requirements not stated. Rather, the above summary ensures that concepts used in the benchmarking\r\nframework are kept as simple as possible. Also, while not an explicit intention, simplifying the activities involved in \u2018making\u2019\r\nregulation allows for greater attention to be devoted to those activities involved in \u2018operating\u2019 regulation, which is the focus of\r\nmost DoJ regulators.\r\nHow governments go about their core business of\r\nmaking and administering regulation2 is the key\r\ndeterminant of regulatory outcomes.3 While regulators\r\nmay differ in role, structure and objectives, the\r\nregulatory cycle is common to all.\r\nAt its most simplified, the regulatory process typically\r\ninvolves:\r\n\u2022 making or passage of government regulation\r\n(make regulation), followed by\r\n\u2022 interpreting, administrating and enforcing that\r\nregulation (operate regulation), and usually\r\nsometime later\r\n\u2022 reviewing how well that regulation is working,\r\nwith the potential for refining, amending, or\r\nrepealing the regulation (review regulation).\r\nFor each of these core elements of the regulatory cycle,\r\nthere is a range of activities that regulators or\r\ngovernment must undertake.\r\nHowever, in many cases an individual regulator will\r\nnot undertake all three stages or activities of the cycle.\r\nFor example, legislation may be recommended and\r\ndrafted (make regulation) by the Department\r\nresponsible for policy advice in the relevant area, a\r\nstatutory authority may administer (operate\r\nregulation) the regulatory scheme established by the\r\nlegislation and the same Department may evaluate the\r\neffectiveness of the scheme after several years of\r\noperation (review regulation).\r\nMake regulation\r\nThe Victorian Guide to Regulation sets out the required\r\nprocess for making regulation and states that\r\ngovernments should assume that regulation is\r\nunnecessary, unless it is clear that:\r\n\u2022 a problem exists\r\n\u2022 government action is justified, and\r\n\u2022 regulation is the best alternative open to the\r\ngovernment.4\r\nIn answering these questions, the Victorian Guide to\r\nRegulation provides detailed guidance on the activities\r\nthat regulators must undertake when making or\r\nremaking regulations. Summarising the key elements\r\nof the Guide, the process to make regulation comprises\r\nthe following:\r\n\u2022 identify objectives\u2014identifying the purposes of\r\nregulatory intervention and establishing the case\r\nfor government action\r\n\u2022 consider alternatives\u2014framing options for meeting\r\nthe identified objectives\r\n\u2022 assess impacts\u2014estimating the impacts of each\r\nalternative scenario, and\r\n\u2022 consult stakeholders\u2014engaging with interested and\r\naffected stakeholders to fully understand the\r\nregulatory environment.5\r\nThese form the basis for the three activities that are\r\nrequired in the make stage.\r\nR\r\nEV\r\nIE\r\nW\r\nMAKE\r\nOPERATE\r\nThe regulatory cycle\r\nThe BBR framework > 07\r\nOperate regulation\r\nEven the best regulation will result in inefficiencies\r\nand poor outcomes if it is not appropriately\r\nadministered and enforced.6\r\nFor most regulators, the majority of their time and\r\nresources is dedicated to the operation of regulation.\r\nIndeed, for many their role almost exclusively relates\r\nto this. While again somewhat simplified for\r\ncategorisation purposes, the core elements of\r\n\u2018operating regulation\u2019 can be distilled into five distinct\r\nactivities:\r\n\u2022 process development\u2014devising systems and\r\nprocesses to manage the tasks involved in\r\nadministering regulation\r\n\u2022 register and license\u2014receiving, assessing, processing,\r\nissuing and maintaining registrations and licences\r\n\u2022 educate and promote\u2014informing regulated parties,\r\nother stakeholders and the general public about\r\nrelevant issues\r\n\u2022 monitor compliance\u2014monitoring the compliance\r\nof regulated parties, and\r\n\u2022 enforce compliance\u2014enforcing the compliance of\r\nregulated parties with relevant regulations.\r\nThese are the basis for the five activities that are\r\nrequired in the operate stage.\r\nNote that not all regulators operate registration or\r\nlicensing as a function in their regulatory schemes.\r\nHowever, it has been added given that it is a very\r\ncommon regulatory tool.\r\nReview regulation\r\nThe Victorian Guide to Regulation states that regulation\r\nshould be evaluated on a regular basis to ensure that it\r\ncontinues to meet its specified objectives. If the\r\nobjectives are not being met, then consideration\r\nshould be given to changing the regulation, or relying\r\non alternative measures to achieve the desired\r\noutcomes.\r\nWhilst not providing guidance on the detail of such a\r\nreview, it can be surmised that the review of regulation\r\nshould:\r\n\u2022 assess performance\u2014are the regulations achieving\r\ntheir objectives\r\n\u2022 review objectives\u2014are the objectives for which the\r\nregulations were implemented still valid, and\r\n\u2022 consider modifications\u2014how the regulations could\r\nbe improved.\r\nAs with the make and operate stages, these points are\r\nthe basis for the two key activities required in the\r\nreview stage.\r\nCoordinate responsibilities\r\nRegulatory functions for a specific scheme may be split\r\namong different branches or agencies. For example,\r\nsuch splits commonly occur between the make and\r\noperate stages and between the operate and review\r\nstages. Sometimes within the operate stage\r\nenforcement may be carried out by a body separate\r\nfrom the body carrying out the licensing or\r\nregistration function. Separating responsibilities within\r\nthe regulatory cycle may be based on a number of\r\nfactors, such as legislative or regulatory requirements,\r\noperational agreements, probity or historical factors.\r\nEach branch or agency involved undertakes to ensure\r\ndelivery of the regulatory processes in a manner that\r\nis, to the greatest extent possible, consistent and\r\nseamless. The framework captures these intersecting\r\nresponsibilities and depicts it in the life cycle of a\r\nregulatory scheme diagram as an over-arching activity\r\nthroughout the cycle. As such, capturing the reality\r\nthat branches or agencies regulators are involved in\r\ndelivering different activities associated with a\r\nregulatory scheme is critical to ensuring the framework\r\nis robust. For this reason, the concept of coordinate\r\nresponsibilities is incorporated. The coordination is\r\ncritical so as to:\r\n\u2022 clearly delineate lines of responsibility for\r\nregulatory activities, and\r\n\u2022 ensure that regulatory activities are performed\r\nefficiently and effectively.\r\nThese points are the basis for the two activities\r\nrequired in coordinate responsibilities. Although not\r\nrepresented in the regulatory cycle diagram, these are\r\nincluded in the good practices tables commencing on\r\npage 11.\r\nFrom a holistic perspective, the BBR framework focuses\r\non regulatory schemes rather than single regulators.\r\nThis enables identification of who carries responsibility\r\nfor the various activities, duplication of activities and\r\nwhere any responsibility gaps may occur.\r\n6 Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal 2006, Investigation into the Burden of Regulation and Improving Regulatory\r\nEfficiency, www.ipart.nsw.gov.au, p. 39.\r\nPractices, processes and performance > 09\r\nPractices, processes\r\nand performance\r\nWhile the activities described above connect the role\r\nof regulators with the principles of good regulation,\r\nthey only provide general guidance on the manner in\r\nwhich regulators should undertake their duties. They\r\ndo not specify practices and processes that regulators\r\nshould comply with and they do not specify standards\r\nby which performance can be gauged.\r\nBy focusing on areas of commonality across the\r\nregulators and the regulatory schemes and in particular\r\nthe regulatory functions, the framework allows for the\r\nevaluation of:\r\n\u2022 good practice\u2014the quality aspects of regulatory\r\nactivities\r\n\u2022 process maturity\u2014the degree of development of\r\nregulatory activities, and\r\n\u2022 performance\u2014the translation of inputs to outputs\r\nto outcomes of regulatory activities.\r\nTherefore, the framework links the practices to the\r\nconceptual model and also allows process quality,\r\nefficiency and effectiveness performance\r\nmeasurements to be linked back to regulatory activities\r\nand acknowledges the specific roles of individual\r\nbusiness units within a regulatory scheme.\r\nPRINCIPLES\r\nGOOD PRACTICE\r\nCOORDINATE RESPONSIBILITIES\r\nR\r\nEV\r\nIE\r\nW\r\nMAKE\r\nOPERATE\r\nReview\r\nobjectives\r\nof the\r\ngovernm\r\nent\r\nintervention\r\nAssess\r\nperformanceof the\r\ngovernment\r\nintervention\r\nId\r\nen\r\ntit\r\ny\r\npr\r\nob\r\nle\r\nm\r\ns\u2019\r\nto\r\nbe\r\nad\r\ndr\r\nes\r\nse\r\nd\r\nby\r\ngo\r\nve\r\nrn\r\nm\r\nen\r\nt\r\nin\r\nte\r\nrv\r\nen\r\ntio\r\nn\r\nDesi\r\ngn\r\ngo\r\nve\r\nrnm\r\nen\r\nt\r\nint\r\nerv\r\nen\r\ntio\r\nn\r\nPlan\r\nimplementation\r\nof government\r\nintervention\r\nMonitor and\r\nenforce\r\ncompliance of\r\nregulated\r\nentities\r\nM\r\nan\r\nag\r\ne\r\non\r\ngo\r\ning\r\nreg\r\nist\r\nrat\r\nion\r\n\/\r\nlic\r\nen\r\nsin\r\ng\r\npr\r\noc\r\nes\r\ns\r\nEducatestakeholders\r\naboutgovernment\r\ninterventionsReceive and\r\nrespond\r\nto\r\nenquiries and\r\ncom\r\nplaints\r\nRegisterand\r\nlicense\r\nentities\r\nActivity Evaluation\r\nPerformance\r\n(inputs, outputs, outcomes)\r\nProcess maturity\r\n(degree of development)\r\nGood practice\r\n(indicators of quality)\r\nReceive and\r\nrespond to\r\nenquiries and\r\ncomplaints\r\nTasks\r\nLevels of evaluation in BBR\r\n10 > Practices, processes and performance\r\n7 Centre for European Studies 2004, Project on Indicators of Regulatory Quality: Final Report, Bradford University\/Commission for\r\nEuropean Communities, http:\/\/www.bradford.ac.uk.irq, accessed 23 November 2006, p. 4.\r\n8 Ibid, p. 4.\r\nAs noted above, the good practices operationalise the\r\nprinciples of good regulation and provide a set of\r\nstandards against which current activities can be\r\nassessed (gap analysis) and opportunities for\r\nimprovements identified.\r\nRegulatory performance\u2014or as some call it \u2018regulatory\r\nquality\u2019\u2014is a complex notion.

As a result it comprises notions of\r\nefficiency, effectiveness and good governance.\r\nIn this way, as Jacobs notes:\r\n[\u2026] principles of better regulation provide a focus on\r\nquality that goes beyond efficiency. In fact, the\r\nexperience of governments and international\r\norganizations indicates that quality is anchored to the\r\nnotion of good governance. As such, regulatory quality\r\nhas a normative dimension, sets goals in terms of\r\ngovernance, and is neutral to the scope and size of\r\npublic intervention. Quality is intimately different from\r\nquantity. High quality regulation does not mean \u2018low\r\nlevels of regulation\u2019, but regulation that is proportionate,\r\ntargeted, efficient, accessible and transparent.7\r\nWhere the conditions of good regulatory quality are\r\nmet\u2014namely, those articulated in the Victorian Guide\r\nto Regulation\u2014regulation will become embedded in\r\npolicy decision\u2013making by regulators, ministers and\r\nstakeholders. Good quality regulation, then, can\r\n\u2018change the way organised interests, firms and citizens\r\nengage in the policy\u2013making process, understand and\r\naccept the regulatory framework\u2019 and promote\r\nregulatory legitimacy.8\r\nDue to the normative dimension of the principles\r\nespoused in the Victorian Guide to Regulation and\r\nsimilar documents, it is difficult to measure the\r\nextent to which a regulatory regime conforms to the\r\nprinciples. In addition, the practices against which\r\nquality and performance are measured might be\r\nemphasised or de\u2013emphasised according to the lens\r\nthrough which they are viewed.\r\nThe approach to develop the good practices was to\r\ndraw on the literature relating to principles of good\r\nregulation, best practice governance, and best practice\r\nadministration to derive or infer good practices for\r\nregulatory activity.\r\nThe good practices provide the bridge between the\r\nprinciples of good regulation \u2013 accountability,\r\ntransparency, effectiveness, efficiency, proportionality,\r\nflexibility and consistency \u2013 and regulatory activities.\r\nThey describe how regulators should perform the tasks\r\nthey have been allocated.\r\nWhile essentially qualitative in nature, they are able to\r\nbe supported by evidence of conformance to or\r\napplication of good practice, and thereby enable\r\nregulatory schemes to identify over time levels of\r\nperformance improvement.\r\nConsideration of good practices also forms an\r\nimportant point for more detailed assessment of\r\nregulatory scheme performance, and ultimately\r\nprovide guidance as to how schemes should be\r\nimproving regulatory tasks and activities. Where\r\ngood practices are not in place, regulators can improve\r\nperformance by embedding the good practices into\r\ntheir operations. Together with the maturity and\r\nquantitative performance of regulatory activities as\r\ndescribed below, the BBR framework will enable\r\nregulatory schemes to identify those good practices\r\nthat have the most crucial or significant impact on\r\nscheme performance.\r\nThe following table sets out the good practices\r\ndeveloped for each of the activities and tasks within\r\nthe regulatory

17\r\nGood practices generally require their processes to be\r\nwell documented, measured and regularly reviewed,\r\naccording to their importance in the overall functions.\r\nThus process maturity applies across many regulatory\r\nactivities and is presented separately in the BBR\r\nframework. Because it does not derive specifically from\r\nthe nature of regulation, but is an accepted good\r\nbusiness practice in general, it is not presented as one\r\nof the good regulatory practices. Nevertheless, it is a\r\npractice directly related to implementing the principles\r\nof accountability, consistency and transparency.\r\nProcess maturity is a way to determine the\r\nsophistication or level of development of processes\r\nacross the regulatory scheme on the basis that the\r\nquality of regulation is likely to be higher if processes\r\na formalised, documented, adhered to in practice and\r\nmeasured.\r\nMeasurement requires a rating to establish the relative\r\ndevelopment and application consistency of each of\r\nthe practices followed by the regulators to determine\r\ntheir \u2018maturity\u2019. It is adapted from the established\r\nprinciples of process maturity typically used when\r\nevaluating organisational processes. Accordingly,\r\nprocess maturity is evaluated to:\r\n\u2022 focus attention on how processes contribute to\r\nregulatory quality as, by definition, the processes\r\nbeing assessed are key to producing regulatory\r\noutcomes\r\n\u2022 establish a link between conduct of these\r\nregulatory activities and improvement\r\nopportunities, and\r\n\u2022 structure and prioritise implementation of\r\nimprovements.\r\nA higher rating would be achieved the greater the\r\ndegree or extent of documentation, measurement,\r\nor promotion of continuous improvement. The\r\nratings are:\r\nLevel 1\u2014Informal and person dependant\r\nThis is for cases where the process being performed\r\nis not documented or formalised. In other words, it is\r\nnot recorded either in outline or in detail. The activity\r\nis person\u2013dependent and the sequence, timing and\r\nresult may vary during repetition, or be sacrificed\r\nunder pressure. This requires significant supervision\r\nand there is no guarantee of either achieving the\r\ndesired result or adhering to timelines. The activity is\r\nad hoc, with the effectiveness of the activity is\r\ndependent on individuals.\r\nLevel 2\u2014Partially documented processes\r\nAt this maturity level, the processes have been\r\nreviewed, documented and approved by the supervisor\r\nor the approving authority as the standard process. But\r\nit may be doubtful that the activity is being performed\r\nin all instances according its documentation. This may\r\nbe because of process drift or a change since the\r\ndocument was drafted.\r\nLevel 3\u2014Fully documented processes\r\nAt this level, there is consistency between the\r\ndocumented process and the deployed process. The\r\nprocess documented and deployed is applied at all the\r\nintended locations, by all supervisors and staff. There is\r\nalso a seamless linkage to other processes wherever\r\nthere needs to be any interaction to ensure a\r\nconsistent level of service.\r\nLevel 4\u2014Level 3 plus measured processes\r\nThe process has set measures and goals, such as\r\nadherence to timelines, customer satisfaction, cost,\r\nand the process is measured against these goals.\r\nProcess variation is reduced through statistical\r\nmanagement with corrective action able to be taken at\r\nthe point of reference. Outcomes can be predicted with\r\naccuracy from organisational capability.\r\nLevel 5\u2014Level 4 plus continuously improvement\r\nAt this level, the goals set for the process are analysed\r\nfor achievements and improved regularly. The\r\ntimelines, cost targets, satisfaction levels are achieved\r\nregularly and the targets are stretched using\r\ncontinuous quality improvement techniques.\r\nImprovements are evaluated and deployed using\r\nsystematic methods.\r\nProcess maturity therefore refers to the level of\r\ndevelopment and formalisation of the processes that\r\nsupport the regulatory activities. It plays an important\r\nrole in managing risk as it encourages regulators to\r\nmove away from person dependent processes, to ones\r\nthat are well documented and understood, where\r\ndocumentation reflects practice, and where\r\nmeasurement is routinely reported and acted on.\r\nRegulators can improve their performance by\r\nconsciously increasing the level of process maturity.\r\nProcess maturity\r\n18 > Practices, processes and performance\r\nThe BBR Framework also allows for performance of\r\nthe regulatory scheme to be considered in terms of:\r\n\u2022 efficiency\u2014indicators developed by considering\r\nthe key inputs and outputs that relate to each\r\nregulatory activity, and\r\n\u2022 effectiveness\u2014indicators developed by\r\nconsidering the overall purpose and outcomes\r\nof the regulatory activity.\r\nThe project has developed a suite of potential\r\nperformance indicators for each of the activities in the\r\nregulatory framework. These performance indicators\r\nare the third set of measures that complete the overall\r\nregulatory performance measurement in the BBR\r\nframework when combined with the process indicators\r\nof good practice and process maturity. In particular\r\nthey have been designed to link to, and hence provide\r\nfurther evidence for, assessments of good practices and\r\nprocess maturity. When interpreted together, the three\r\nsets of indicators provide a broad and more complete\r\npicture of regulatory performance that includes\r\nassessments of operational activities (efficiency) and of\r\nregulatory outcomes (effectiveness). The positioning of\r\nthe performance indicators within the BBR\r\nmeasurement framework is illustrated below.\r\nDevelopment of performance\r\nindicators\r\nThe development of the performance indicators\r\ninvolved the identification of indicator concepts for\r\neach activity, where the indicator concept posed the\r\nquestion \u2018what do we need to know?\u2019 to gauge\r\nperformance for each activity. One or more\r\nperformance indicators for each activity were\r\ndeveloped from these indicator concepts. They are\r\nmost informative when viewed as a suite of indicators\r\nand not interpreted as isolated measures. If\r\nperformance against single indicators is relied upon\r\nwithout the balance that occurs when the indicators\r\nare viewed collectively, inaccurate interpretations may\r\nbe made leading to inappropriate decision-making.\r\nThe performance indicators are also designed so that\r\ndirectional changes provide clear and unambiguous\r\ninterpretations of performance. This means that goals\r\nor targets can be assigned to each indicator once\r\nsufficient data has been obtained to determine the\r\nappropriate level.\r\nWhere possible, the performance indicators are\r\nexpressed in generic language that is applicable across\r\nregulatory schemes. Not all of the indicators will apply\r\nto all schemes\u2014for example, if a scheme does not\r\ninclude licensing provisions then the licensing related\r\nindicators would not apply. For some schemes it may\r\nbe helpful to tailor the language to reflect that\r\ncustomarily used within that scheme.\r\nOverall, the performance indicators reflect the nature\r\nof the activities within each of the make, operate and\r\nreview stages and coordinate responsibilities. It should\r\nalso be noted that the performance indicators, as well\r\nas the good practices and process maturity measures,\r\ncan be used for comparing regulatory performance\r\nwithin a specific scheme over a time and also across\r\nregulatory schemes.\r\nHowever, the performance indicators even when\r\ncombined with the good practices and process\r\nmaturity measures do not provide all the management\r\ninformation that may be required by those managing\r\nregulatory activities and tasks. There are many other\r\npieces of information relating to operational detail that\r\nare important for management to access when making\r\ndecisions. Therefore, it is intended that managers will\r\nseek more information than is represented by the\r\nperformance indicators. For example, those managing\r\na licensing process should be aware of the number of\r\nlicence applications received. This data may well\r\nconvey crucial information about the licensing\r\nintervention and inform decisions about the resources\r\nrequired to process the applications, even though the\r\nnumber of applications received does not in itself\r\nconstitute performance data.\r\nPerformance\r\nmeasurement\r\nRegulatory\r\nobjective\r\nRegulatory\r\nperformance\r\nPerformance\r\nmeasurement\r\nProcess\r\nmaturity\r\nGood\r\npractice\r\nPerformance\r\nindicators\r\nProcess\r\nindicators\r\nRegulatory\r\nactivities\r\nStandard regulatory approaches\r\nBBR approach\r\nMeasuring regulatory performance in the\r\nBBR Framework\r\nMaking it work > 19\r\nThe BBR framework can be applied in two modes:\r\na) A \u2018one-off\u2019 evaluation to assess a regulator\u2019s\r\ncurrent practice against the standard of the good\r\npractices (gap analysis) to identify improvements.\r\nThere is the option of repeating this periodically\r\nat medium to long term intervals, say every three\r\nyears. Key steps in this type of application are:\r\n\u2022 gap analysis\r\n\u2022 interpret and understand reasons for gaps\r\n\u2022 identify priority areas for improvement\r\n\u2022 design and plan an improvement strategy\r\n\u2022 implement the improvement strategy\r\n\u2022 monitor results and review outcomes.\r\nb) Ongoing monitoring of performance using the\r\ngeneric performance measures in terms of\r\nefficiency and effectiveness. Key steps in this\r\ntype of application are:\r\n\u2022 adapt BBR generic performance measures\r\nto the specific regulator or scheme\r\n\u2022 determine data needs and availability\r\n(eg is current data adequate for purposes?)\r\n\u2022 collect data\r\n\u2022 estimate measures\r\n\u2022 interpret measures and trends\r\n\u2022 identify particular activities for further\r\nassessment and improvement (eg measures\r\nmay indicate problems areas but not the\r\ncauses, that may require much more detailed\r\nand specific analysis).\r\nBoth of these modes of application are through a self-\r\nevaluation process. Self evaluation can be a useful\r\nvehicle for accurate identification of strengths and\r\nopportunities for improvement. It is also a learning\r\nopportunity supporting managers to better understand\r\nand assess the practices and processes within their area\r\nof accountability and should be seen as a starting point\r\nfor continuous improvement. The BBR framework is\r\ndesigned to be implemented using a self evaluation\r\nprocess with facilitated workshops to develop action\r\nplans for improving regulatory performance.\r\nThe BBR framework was piloted by Consumer Affairs\r\nVictoria on two regulatory schemes using this\r\nmethodology for the purposes of:\r\n\u2022 assessing the evaluation framework as a\r\ndiagnostic tool to measure regulatory\r\nperformance\r\n\u2022 assessing the associated approaches and processes\r\ninvolved in its application, and\r\n\u2022 identifying areas that need to be taken into\r\naccount for wider application of the BBR\r\nframework.\r\nThe pilot confirmed that the BBR framework has the\r\ncapacity to identify issues and opportunities for\r\nimprovement. The challenge will be to tailor and\r\nincorporate further improvements and examine\r\nopportunities to embed a continuous improvement\r\nculture amongst different regulators.\r\nMaking it work\r\nCAV research and discussion papers > 21\r\n1 Consumer Education in Schools: Background Report,\r\nNovember 2003\r\n2 What do we Mean by \u2018Vulnerable\u2019 and\r\n\u2018Disadvantaged\u2019 Consumers?, March 2004\r\n3 Information Provision and Education Strategies,\r\nMarch 2006\r\n4 Social Marketing and Consumer Policy, March 2006\r\n5 Designing Quality Rating Schemes for Service\r\nProviders, March 2006\r\n6 Regulating the Cost of Credit, March 2006\r\n7 Consumer Advocacy in Victoria, March 2006\r\n8 Choosing Between General and Industry-specific\r\nRegulation, November 2006\r\n9 Using Licensing to Protect Consumers\u2019 Interests,\r\nNovember 2006\r\n10 Consumer Detriment in Victoria: a Survey of its\r\nNature, Costs and Implications, October 2006\r\n11 Stopping Rogue Traders, November 2006\r\n12 Unfair Contract Terms in Victoria: Research into\r\ntheir Extent, Nature, Cost and Implications,\r\nOctober 2007\r\n13 Institutional Arrangements for Consumer Protection\r\nAgencies, April 2008\r\n14 Better Business Regulation, May 2008\r\nConsumer Affairs Victoria\r\nresearch and discussion\r\npapers\r\nMay 2008\r\nC-68-01-1090\r\nConsumer Affairs Victoria\r\nVictorian Consumer & Business Centre\r\n113 Exhibition Street\r\nMelbourne 3000\r\nTelephone 1300 55 81 81 (local call charge)\r\nEmail consumer@justice.vic.gov.au\r\nWebsite www.consumer.vic.gov.au\r\nRegional offices are located in Ballarat,\r\nBendigo, Geelong, Morwell, Mildura,\r\nWangaratta and Warrnambool.\r\n \n"}],"executorName":"pool-1-thread-1","line":6,"name":"Extract text from a PDF","description":"","durationMillis":2479.51,"startTime":1685093345951,"failed":false,"refId":"[1:6]","endTime":1685093348820,"exampleIndex":-1}],"callDepth":0,"name":"Extract Text from PDF using PDFBox","description":"","resultDate":"2023-05-26 07:29:08 pm","durationMillis":2479.51,"passedCount":1}
