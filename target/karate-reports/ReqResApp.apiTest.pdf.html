Preface
Consumer Affairs Victoria (CAV) is a significant market
place regulator. It administers both economy-wide and
industry-specific legislation covering thousands of
providers of goods and services. The agency combines
both policy and regulation making functions with
regulation implementation functions. CAV has been
committed to achieving best practice in performing
its regulatory roles.
There has been much discussion of the need to
improve the processes of making regulation in recent
years, but much less focus on improving the practices
of regulators in implementing regulation. Experience
suggests to me that often the more significant gains
can be achieved by improving what regulators do
rather than tinkering with what is on the statute
books.
This view prompted CAV to initiate a Better Business
Regulation project, the simple aim of which was to
improve CAV’s regulatory practices. Subsequently, the
Victorian Government established a Regulation
Burden Reduction initiative, which further emphasised
the need to improve regulatory quality. CAV is a
portfolio unit of the Department of Justice in Victoria
and the Department embraced both the Better
Business Regulation and Regulation Burden Reduction
initiatives as key priorities in 2006-2008.
This paper describes the Better Business Regulation
framework developed by CAV and the Department of
Justice. It is hoped that other regulators will be able to
benefit from the work we have done by applying the
framework to their own circumstances and ultimately
effecting improvements to their regulation.
I would like to acknowledge the work done by Rod
Overall (Overall Consulting) and the Allen Consulting
Group who have greatly assisted CAV in developing
the Better Business Regulation framework. The
combination of experience of the consultants and staff
involved in the project has, I believe, produced a
practical and innovative approach to assist in the
promotion of regulatory reform.
Consumer Affairs Victoria would welcome any
comments on the Better Business Regulation
framework. These may be directed to:

The objective of the Better Business Regulation (BBR)
project is to improve the way regulators operate by
developing a tool (the BBR Framework) that assists in
evaluating performance, identifying opportunities for
improvement and developing measures to monitor
performance over time.
BBR originated in a search by Consumer Affairs
Victoria (CAV) to identify ‘good practice’ in its
regulatory activities. An extensive literature search
revealed that although there are widely accepted
principles of ‘good regulation’, they concentrated
on the application of these principles in making
regulation (primary and subordinate legislation).
There was little information on what constituted
good regulatory practice.
The project was initiated by CAV in 2005 and
extended across the whole of the Department of
Justice (DoJ) to develop and test a conceptual
framework to provide guidance on good practice for
regulators. Underlying this was a premise that the
activities regulators undertake are essentially similar,
regardless of the particular object of the regulation, so
that it should be possible to formulate standards
(termed ‘good practices’) against which regulators’ can
assess current practices and identify opportunities for
improvement.
A conceptual framework was developed from the
accepted principles and the literature, particularly from
United Kingdom governmental sources. On the basis
of that framework, an Evaluation Guide was developed
and piloted for its workability in two regulatory
schemes operated by Consumer Affairs Victoria.
Modifications were made following a review of the
pilot’s outcomes. From mid 2008 and over an
18 month period, the framework will be rolled out
across all regulators within the Justice portfolio.
This paper explains the BBR Framework and the broad
processes for its application. Readers interested in more
detail are referred to the departmental contact noted in
the Preface.
Introduction
Introduction &gt; 01
Better business regulation &gt; 03
This project is being undertaken in the context of the
Victorian government’s commitment to improving
regulation.
The BBR project was initiated by Consumer Affairs
Victoria as a way of improving the quality of its
regulatory practice. It now also forms part of the
Department of Justice’s effort to delivering reductions
in regulatory burden and improving the effectiveness
of regulation. It has been a DoJ Strategic Priority for
the last three years.
DoJ is focusing on regulatory improvement which
includes the Government’s broader commitment to
Reducing the Regulatory Burden, a
whole–of–government approach to reducing the
administrative burdens of regulation.
The BBR project will encourage better regulatory
practice and ultimately lead to better regulatory
outcomes. In this regard, the BBR project will support
the Reducing the Regulatory Burden initiative and
improve the way regulators operate by highlighting
areas for regulatory improvement.

Context
The Victorian Government announced the Reducing
the Regulatory Burden initiative in 2006, designed to
reduce the administrative burdens of State
regulation. The Department of Treasury and Finance
(DTF) has estimated that the administrative burden
imposed by State regulation is $1.03 billion per
annum.
The Victorian Government’s approach is centred
on three elements:
1. reducing the existing administrative burden of
regulation by 15 per cent ($154 million) by July
2009 and 25 per cent ($256 million) by July
2011
2. offsetting the administrative burden of any new
regulation by making simplifications in the
same or related area, and
3. undertaking reviews to identify actions to
reduce compliance burdens, supported by
incentive payments.

Principles of good regulation
Any exercise in evaluating regulatory practice and
processes requires consideration of the principles of
good regulation. These include:
• accountability
• transparency
• effectiveness
• efficiency
• proportionality
• flexibility, and
• consistency1.
For Victorian regulators the Department of Treasury
and Finance Victorian Guide to Regulation provides
a useful introduction to these principles. Many of the
principles in the Victorian Guide to Regulation are
also relevant for the day–to–day business of regulators
when operating regulation. However, developing
specific good practices, particularly those related to
operating regulation are not explicitly stated and need
to be derived or inferred from the relevant literature.
The interpretation of ‘core’ principles can then be used
to test the appropriateness of the standards.
The BBR project has been undertaken in five stages
with Stage 1 designed to answer two key questions:
1. is it possible to develop a common framework
for assessing regulatory performance across the
diverse business regulators in DoJ, and if so
2. what would a set of workable indicators of good
practice look like?
Stage 1 of the project focused on:
• consideration of approaches to benchmarking
regulatory functions in Australia and overseas
with a view to drawing upon existing
performance indicators and the experience of
other regulators, and
• developing a framework for benchmarking
regulators and a recommended set of
observable/measurable indicators of regulatory
performance that:
• is readily applicable to all business–related
regulatory functions undertaken within DoJ
• assists the subsequent task of identifying
areas for improvement in DoJ regulators
• provides guidance on the application of the
framework and indicators, and
• facilitates a pilot of the methodology in
two regulatory schemes.
Stage 1, which was completed in early 2007, resulted
in the development of a preliminary BBR framework.
The framework focused on the similar regulatory
activities performed by the diverse schemes within the
Justice Portfolio rather than on the very different
regulatory outcomes being pursued by the various
regulators.
The framework established in Stage 1 was subsequently
trialled and modified during Stage 2, the purpose of
which was to:
• assess the BBR evaluation framework as a
diagnostic tool to assess regulatory performance
• assess the associated approaches and processes
involved in applying the BBR evaluation
framework, and
• identify areas that need to be taken into account
for wider application of the BBR evaluation
framework across CAV and other DoJ regulators.
Stage 2 concluded that it was possible to apply a
common framework for evaluation and assessment
across the diverse regulators in DoJ. Importantly, this
conceptual framework was translated into a
comprehensive set of good practices allowing
regulators to self-evaluate their regulatory processes.
Stage 3 utilised the findings of the Stage 2 pilots and
translated these into strategic action plans articulating
the regulators response to the findings of the pilots.
These action plans clearly outlined specific
improvement opportunities, assigned responsibilities
and specified timeframes for implementation. Finally,
a regular reporting mechanism was established to
review progress towards regulatory process
improvements.
04 &gt; Better business regulation
1 This list includes those principles most applicable to all stages of the regulatory cycle. Efficiency has been included as it is
important for the operate stage, perhaps less so for the make and review stages, even though it does not form part of the
Victorian Guide to Regulation. Flexibility refers to a regulator being adaptive (eg enforcement strategies, promoting compliance,
risk assessments) to changing circumstances. Cooperation has not been included as this is an over-arching activity in the
regulatory cycle and covered elsewhere.
Project approach
The BBR framework &gt; 05
The BBR framework
The following sections provide an overview of this
framework starting with a discussion, at a conceptual
level, of the regulatory cycle.
The framework maps generic regulatory activities
across the life cycle of a regulatory scheme. It is broken
into three stages—make, operate and review—and
shows the activities that are required at each of these
stages. Although not represented in the diagram, each
of the 10 activities around the three stages is further
broken down into specific tasks with good practices
that should ideally be in place for each of the tasks.
With many activities in the cycle performed by
different branches or agencies, coordination of
responsibilities becomes a large component throughout
the regulatory cycle. Accordingly, it is represented in
the diagram as a continuum around the cycle.
While in concept the regulatory cycle is not new, the
good practices developed for each of the activities
within the regulatory cycle have not been brought
together in this way in the extensive literature
reviewed. By drawing on the Victorian Guide to
Regulation, other principles of good regulation, and
experience from other jurisdictions, the BBR project
derived or inferred the practices to which regulators
should adhere. In all, the BBR framework proposes
74 good practices for the 10 regulatory activities
around the make, operate and review stages and the
coordination responsiblities.
To assist with the identification of those ‘similar’
regulatory activities, the concept of a regulatory cycle
was developed as set out below.

Life cycle of a regulatory scheme
06 &gt; The BBR framework
2 The discussion in this report is designed to be inclusive and therefore the term ‘regulation’ should be interpreted in its wider
sense to include all government regulatory instruments including primary legislation and sub–ordinate legislation (called
‘Regulation’) rather than sub–ordinate legislation only.

5 It should be noted that the above summary is by no means a substitute for the Victorian Guide to Regulation—in fact, the
Guide is the endorsed Government policy on developing regulation—nor is the summary intended to provide greater emphasis
relative to those requirements not stated. Rather, the above summary ensures that concepts used in the benchmarking
framework are kept as simple as possible. Also, while not an explicit intention, simplifying the activities involved in ‘making’
regulation allows for greater attention to be devoted to those activities involved in ‘operating’ regulation, which is the focus of
most DoJ regulators.
How governments go about their core business of
making and administering regulation2 is the key
determinant of regulatory outcomes.3 While regulators
may differ in role, structure and objectives, the
regulatory cycle is common to all.
At its most simplified, the regulatory process typically
involves:
• making or passage of government regulation
(make regulation), followed by
• interpreting, administrating and enforcing that
regulation (operate regulation), and usually
sometime later
• reviewing how well that regulation is working,
with the potential for refining, amending, or
repealing the regulation (review regulation).
For each of these core elements of the regulatory cycle,
there is a range of activities that regulators or
government must undertake.
However, in many cases an individual regulator will
not undertake all three stages or activities of the cycle.
For example, legislation may be recommended and
drafted (make regulation) by the Department
responsible for policy advice in the relevant area, a
statutory authority may administer (operate
regulation) the regulatory scheme established by the
legislation and the same Department may evaluate the
effectiveness of the scheme after several years of
operation (review regulation).
Make regulation
The Victorian Guide to Regulation sets out the required
process for making regulation and states that
governments should assume that regulation is
unnecessary, unless it is clear that:
• a problem exists
• government action is justified, and
• regulation is the best alternative open to the
government.4
In answering these questions, the Victorian Guide to
Regulation provides detailed guidance on the activities
that regulators must undertake when making or
remaking regulations. Summarising the key elements
of the Guide, the process to make regulation comprises
the following:
• identify objectives—identifying the purposes of
regulatory intervention and establishing the case
for government action
• consider alternatives—framing options for meeting
the identified objectives
• assess impacts—estimating the impacts of each
alternative scenario, and
• consult stakeholders—engaging with interested and
affected stakeholders to fully understand the
regulatory environment.5
These form the basis for the three activities that are
required in the make stage.

The BBR framework &gt; 07
Operate regulation
Even the best regulation will result in inefficiencies
and poor outcomes if it is not appropriately
administered and enforced.6
For most regulators, the majority of their time and
resources is dedicated to the operation of regulation.
Indeed, for many their role almost exclusively relates
to this. While again somewhat simplified for
categorisation purposes, the core elements of
‘operating regulation’ can be distilled into five distinct
activities:
• process development—devising systems and
processes to manage the tasks involved in
administering regulation
• register and license—receiving, assessing, processing,
issuing and maintaining registrations and licences
• educate and promote—informing regulated parties,
other stakeholders and the general public about
relevant issues
• monitor compliance—monitoring the compliance
of regulated parties, and
• enforce compliance—enforcing the compliance of
regulated parties with relevant regulations.
These are the basis for the five activities that are
required in the operate stage.
Note that not all regulators operate registration or
licensing as a function in their regulatory schemes.
However, it has been added given that it is a very
common regulatory tool.
Review regulation
The Victorian Guide to Regulation states that regulation
should be evaluated on a regular basis to ensure that it
continues to meet its specified objectives. If the
objectives are not being met, then consideration
should be given to changing the regulation, or relying
on alternative measures to achieve the desired
outcomes.
Whilst not providing guidance on the detail of such a
review, it can be surmised that the review of regulation
should:
• assess performance—are the regulations achieving
their objectives
• review objectives—are the objectives for which the
regulations were implemented still valid, and
• consider modifications—how the regulations could
be improved.
As with the make and operate stages, these points are
the basis for the two key activities required in the
review stage.
Coordinate responsibilities
Regulatory functions for a specific scheme may be split
among different branches or agencies. For example,
such splits commonly occur between the make and
operate stages and between the operate and review
stages. Sometimes within the operate stage
enforcement may be carried out by a body separate
from the body carrying out the licensing or
registration function. Separating responsibilities within
the regulatory cycle may be based on a number of
factors, such as legislative or regulatory requirements,
operational agreements, probity or historical factors.
Each branch or agency involved undertakes to ensure
delivery of the regulatory processes in a manner that
is, to the greatest extent possible, consistent and
seamless. The framework captures these intersecting
responsibilities and depicts it in the life cycle of a
regulatory scheme diagram as an over-arching activity
throughout the cycle. As such, capturing the reality
that branches or agencies regulators are involved in
delivering different activities associated with a
regulatory scheme is critical to ensuring the framework
is robust. For this reason, the concept of coordinate
responsibilities is incorporated. The coordination is
critical so as to:
• clearly delineate lines of responsibility for
regulatory activities, and
• ensure that regulatory activities are performed
efficiently and effectively.
These points are the basis for the two activities
required in coordinate responsibilities. Although not
represented in the regulatory cycle diagram, these are
included in the good practices tables commencing on
page 11.
From a holistic perspective, the BBR framework focuses
on regulatory schemes rather than single regulators.
This enables identification of who carries responsibility
for the various activities, duplication of activities and
where any responsibility gaps may occur.

Efficiency, www.ipart.nsw.gov.au, p. 39.
Practices, processes and performance &gt; 09
Practices, processes
and performance
While the activities described above connect the role
of regulators with the principles of good regulation,
they only provide general guidance on the manner in
which regulators should undertake their duties. They
do not specify practices and processes that regulators
should comply with and they do not specify standards
by which performance can be gauged.
By focusing on areas of commonality across the
regulators and the regulatory schemes and in particular
the regulatory functions, the framework allows for the
evaluation of:
• good practice—the quality aspects of regulatory
activities
• process maturity—the degree of development of
regulatory activities, and
• performance—the translation of inputs to outputs
to outcomes of regulatory activities.
Therefore, the framework links the practices to the
conceptual model and also allows process quality,
efficiency and effectiveness performance
measurements to be linked back to regulatory activities
and acknowledges the specific roles of individual
business units within a regulatory scheme.

As noted above, the good practices operationalise the
principles of good regulation and provide a set of
standards against which current activities can be
assessed (gap analysis) and opportunities for
improvements identified.
Regulatory performance—or as some call it ‘regulatory
quality’—is a complex notion. It links the effects of a
regulatory process with the principles of good
regulation. As a result it comprises notions of
efficiency, effectiveness and good governance.
In this way, as Jacobs notes:
[…] principles of better regulation provide a focus on
quality that goes beyond efficiency. In fact, the
experience of governments and international
organizations indicates that quality is anchored to the
notion of good governance. As such, regulatory quality
has a normative dimension, sets goals in terms of
governance, and is neutral to the scope and size of
public intervention. Quality is intimately different from
quantity. High quality regulation does not mean ‘low
levels of regulation’, but regulation that is proportionate,
targeted, efficient, accessible and transparent.7
Where the conditions of good regulatory quality are
met—namely, those articulated in the Victorian Guide
to Regulation—regulation will become embedded in
policy decision–making by regulators, ministers and
stakeholders. Good quality regulation, then, can
‘change the way organised interests, firms and citizens
engage in the policy–making process, understand and
accept the regulatory framework’ and promote
regulatory legitimacy.8
Due to the normative dimension of the principles
espoused in the Victorian Guide to Regulation and
similar documents, it is difficult to measure the
extent to which a regulatory regime conforms to the
principles. In addition, the practices against which
quality and performance are measured might be
emphasised or de–emphasised according to the lens
through which they are viewed.
The approach to develop the good practices was to
draw on the literature relating to principles of good
regulation, best practice governance, and best practice
administration to derive or infer good practices for
regulatory activity.
The good practices provide the bridge between the
principles of good regulation – accountability,
transparency, effectiveness, efficiency, proportionality,
flexibility and consistency – and regulatory activities.
They describe how regulators should perform the tasks
they have been allocated.
While essentially qualitative in nature, they are able to
be supported by evidence of conformance to or
application of good practice, and thereby enable
regulatory schemes to identify over time levels of
performance improvement.
Consideration of good practices also forms an
important point for more detailed assessment of
regulatory scheme performance, and ultimately
provide guidance as to how schemes should be
improving regulatory tasks and activities. Where
good practices are not in place, regulators can improve
performance by embedding the good practices into
their operations. Together with the maturity and
quantitative performance of regulatory activities as
described below, the BBR framework will enable
regulatory schemes to identify those good practices
that have the most crucial or significant impact on
scheme performance.
The following table sets out the good practices
developed for each of the activities and tasks within
the regulatory cycle.

Practices, processes and performance &gt; 17
Good practices generally require their processes to be
well documented, measured and regularly reviewed,
according to their importance in the overall functions.
Thus process maturity applies across many regulatory
activities and is presented separately in the BBR
framework. Because it does not derive specifically from
the nature of regulation, but is an accepted good
business practice in general, it is not presented as one
of the good regulatory practices. Nevertheless, it is a
practice directly related to implementing the principles
of accountability, consistency and transparency.
Process maturity is a way to determine the
sophistication or level of development of processes
across the regulatory scheme on the basis that the
quality of regulation is likely to be higher if processes
a formalised, documented, adhered to in practice and
measured.
Measurement requires a rating to establish the relative
development and application consistency of each of
the practices followed by the regulators to determine
their ‘maturity’. It is adapted from the established
principles of process maturity typically used when
evaluating organisational processes. Accordingly,
process maturity is evaluated to:
• focus attention on how processes contribute to
regulatory quality as, by definition, the processes
being assessed are key to producing regulatory
outcomes
• establish a link between conduct of these
regulatory activities and improvement
opportunities, and
• structure and prioritise implementation of
improvements.
A higher rating would be achieved the greater the
degree or extent of documentation, measurement,
or promotion of continuous improvement. The
ratings are:
Level 1—Informal and person dependant
This is for cases where the process being performed
is not documented or formalised. In other words, it is
not recorded either in outline or in detail. The activity
is person–dependent and the sequence, timing and
result may vary during repetition, or be sacrificed
under pressure. This requires significant supervision
and there is no guarantee of either achieving the
desired result or adhering to timelines. The activity is
ad hoc, with the effectiveness of the activity is
dependent on individuals.
Level 2—Partially documented processes
At this maturity level, the processes have been
reviewed, documented and approved by the supervisor
or the approving authority as the standard process. But
it may be doubtful that the activity is being performed
in all instances according its documentation. This may
be because of process drift or a change since the
document was drafted.
Level 3—Fully documented processes
At this level, there is consistency between the
documented process and the deployed process. The
process documented and deployed is applied at all the
intended locations, by all supervisors and staff. There is
also a seamless linkage to other processes wherever
there needs to be any interaction to ensure a
consistent level of service.
Level 4—Level 3 plus measured processes
The process has set measures and goals, such as
adherence to timelines, customer satisfaction, cost,
and the process is measured against these goals.
Process variation is reduced through statistical
management with corrective action able to be taken at
the point of reference. Outcomes can be predicted with
accuracy from organisational capability.
Level 5—Level 4 plus continuously improvement
At this level, the goals set for the process are analysed
for achievements and improved regularly. The
timelines, cost targets, satisfaction levels are achieved
regularly and the targets are stretched using
continuous quality improvement techniques.
Improvements are evaluated and deployed using
systematic methods.
Process maturity therefore refers to the level of
development and formalisation of the processes that
support the regulatory activities. It plays an important
role in managing risk as it encourages regulators to
move away from person dependent processes, to ones
that are well documented and understood, where
documentation reflects practice, and where
measurement is routinely reported and acted on.
Regulators can improve their performance by
consciously increasing the level of process maturity.
Process maturity
18 &gt; Practices, processes and performance
The BBR Framework also allows for performance of
the regulatory scheme to be considered in terms of:
• efficiency—indicators developed by considering
the key inputs and outputs that relate to each
regulatory activity, and
• effectiveness—indicators developed by
considering the overall purpose and outcomes
of the regulatory activity.
The project has developed a suite of potential
performance indicators for each of the activities in the
regulatory framework. These performance indicators
are the third set of measures that complete the overall
regulatory performance measurement in the BBR
framework when combined with the process indicators
of good practice and process maturity. In particular
they have been designed to link to, and hence provide
further evidence for, assessments of good practices and
process maturity. When interpreted together, the three
sets of indicators provide a broad and more complete
picture of regulatory performance that includes
assessments of operational activities (efficiency) and of
regulatory outcomes (effectiveness). The positioning of
the performance indicators within the BBR
measurement framework is illustrated below.
Development of performance
indicators
The development of the performance indicators
involved the identification of indicator concepts for
each activity, where the indicator concept posed the
question ‘what do we need to know?’ to gauge
performance for each activity. One or more
performance indicators for each activity were
developed from these indicator concepts. They are
most informative when viewed as a suite of indicators
and not interpreted as isolated measures. If
performance against single indicators is relied upon
without the balance that occurs when the indicators
are viewed collectively, inaccurate interpretations may
be made leading to inappropriate decision-making.
The performance indicators are also designed so that
directional changes provide clear and unambiguous
interpretations of performance. This means that goals
or targets can be assigned to each indicator once
sufficient data has been obtained to determine the
appropriate level.
Where possible, the performance indicators are
expressed in generic language that is applicable across
regulatory schemes. Not all of the indicators will apply
to all schemes—for example, if a scheme does not
include licensing provisions then the licensing related
indicators would not apply. For some schemes it may
be helpful to tailor the language to reflect that
customarily used within that scheme.
Overall, the performance indicators reflect the nature
of the activities within each of the make, operate and
review stages and coordinate responsibilities. It should
also be noted that the performance indicators, as well
as the good practices and process maturity measures,
can be used for comparing regulatory performance
within a specific scheme over a time and also across
regulatory schemes.
However, the performance indicators even when
combined with the good practices and process
maturity measures do not provide all the management
information that may be required by those managing
regulatory activities and tasks. There are many other
pieces of information relating to operational detail that
are important for management to access when making
decisions. Therefore, it is intended that managers will
seek more information than is represented by the
performance indicators. For example, those managing
a licensing process should be aware of the number of
licence applications received. This data may well
convey crucial information about the licensing
intervention and inform decisions about the resources
required to process the applications, even though the
number of applications received does not in itself
constitute performance data.

Making it work &gt; 19
The BBR framework can be applied in two modes:
a) A ‘one-off’ evaluation to assess a regulator’s
current practice against the standard of the good
practices (gap analysis) to identify improvements.
There is the option of repeating this periodically
at medium to long term intervals, say every three
years. Key steps in this type of application are:
• gap analysis
• interpret and understand reasons for gaps
• identify priority areas for improvement
• design and plan an improvement strategy
• implement the improvement strategy
• monitor results and review outcomes.
b) Ongoing monitoring of performance using the
generic performance measures in terms of
efficiency and effectiveness. Key steps in this
type of application are:
• adapt BBR generic performance measures
to the specific regulator or scheme
• determine data needs and availability
(eg is current data adequate for purposes?)
• collect data
• estimate measures
• interpret measures and trends
• identify particular activities for further
assessment and improvement (eg measures
may indicate problems areas but not the
causes, that may require much more detailed
and specific analysis).
Both of these modes of application are through a self-
evaluation process. Self evaluation can be a useful
vehicle for accurate identification of strengths and
opportunities for improvement. It is also a learning
opportunity supporting managers to better understand
and assess the practices and processes within their area
of accountability and should be seen as a starting point
for continuous improvement. The BBR framework is
designed to be implemented using a self evaluation
process with facilitated workshops to develop action
plans for improving regulatory performance.
The BBR framework was piloted by Consumer Affairs
Victoria on two regulatory schemes using this
methodology for the purposes of:
• assessing the evaluation framework as a
diagnostic tool to measure regulatory
performance
• assessing the associated approaches and processes
involved in its application, and
• identifying areas that need to be taken into
account for wider application of the BBR
framework.
The pilot confirmed that the BBR framework has the
capacity to identify issues and opportunities for
improvement. The challenge will be to tailor and
incorporate further improvements and examine
opportunities to embed a continuous improvement
culture amongst different regulators.
